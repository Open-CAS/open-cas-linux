Open CAS  accelerates Linux applications by caching active (hot) data to
a local flash device inside servers. Open CAS implements caching at the
server level, utilizing local high-performance flash media as the cache drive
media inside the application server as close as possible to the CPU, thus
reducing storage latency as much as possible.
The Open Cache Acceleration Software installs into the GNU/Linux operating
system itself, as a kernel module. The nature of the integration provides a
cache solution that is transparent to users and  applications, and your
existing storage infrastructure. No storage migration effort or application
changes are required.
